# Goffold

Go based CLI to create Golang projects with a streamlined, and opinionated structure.

## Features

- Generate project templates for CLI applications, web applications, microservices, or your own desires.
- Consistent and organized project structures with (your) best practices and dependencies.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Note

Please note that this CLI is primarily for personal use and is not production-ready. I do not intend to provide support unless i see a general benefit. However, issues and improvements are welcome but must be submitted in the form of merge requests.
